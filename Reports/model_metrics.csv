Gradient boosting model to predict longevity in the London wards: ,
Model features:,
Life_Expectancy - Rolling 5-year combined life expectancies are used for wards to reduce the effects of the variability in number of deaths in each year. ,
,
Childhood_Obesity - Children with a BMI greater than or equal to the 95th centile of the British 1990 growth reference (UK90) BMI distribution have been classified as obese.,
,
Incapacity_Benefit - Incapacity Benefit (IB) rate. Incapacity Benefit is paid to people who are incapable of work and who meet certain contribution conditions. ,
,
Unemployment - Percentage of working-age residents claiming Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) or National Insurance Credits. JSA is a benefit payable to unemployed people.,
,
"Crime - Crime rate. Index scores of overall notifiable offences per 1,000 daytime population. ",
,
"Deliberate_Fires - Rate of all Deliberate Fire incidents (arson) recorded by the London Fire & Emergency Planning Authority per 1,000 population.",
,
GCSE_points- GCSE average point scores for pupils at the end of Key Stage 4 (KS4) in maintained schools.,
,
Unauthorised_Absence - Pupil Absence in all maintained schools is absence without permission from a teacher or other authorized representative of the school. ,
,
Dependent_children - % of Children living in Out-of-work Benefit Claimant Households. ,
,
"Public_Transport_Access- The average Public Transport Accessibility Level (PTAL) score. PTALs are a detailed and accurate measure of the accessibility of a point to the public transport network, taking into account walk access time and service availability. ",
,
"Greenspace_access - Homes with access to open space, and proportion of area that is greenspace. An average of these two measures was taken for each area. ",
,
Greenspace_Surface_Area: Total greenspace surface area for each London Borough.,
,
Total_Greenspace: Binned metric for greenspace_surface_area. Bins (low/med/high) are based on equally dividing the data into three bins.,
,
,
Hyperparameters:,
I tuned two hyperparameters for the GradientBoostingRegressor using GridSearchCV.,
 n_estimators,500
max_depth ,10

,
Model performance metrics on test data: ,
r-squared,0.77
